# Zombie Game - Introduction

This was the starting point when I was assigned this project. In here is where I have written all the necessary things I wanted to include in my Phaser Platform game even though I didn't eventually managed to have all of them in this final version of the game. 

# Story

In year 2038, science made one more mistake. After trying to create a medicine to heal humanity's worst enemy,called Virus-8493, one explosion was enough to spread the germ and infect thousands of people. Nowadays, infected people are walking around like living-dead creatures, ready to conquer the world  and extinct human race. They have managed to declare a some kind of captain among them who cannot  fill his hunger of human flesh.His name is Slaughter King and he will try his best so there wont be any HUMAN left on planet Earth....

## Stage 1

Slaughter Kind is your player now and while going up in this stage your goal is to reach a score of 251 in order to advance to the next stage. Each enemy you are killing earns you 10 points.

## 1st Pop-Up Message

You have managed to eat many HUMAN BEINGS so far... There are lots of them as you are going up. They are trying to stay away from your jaws... Even though, you have to keep your \nreputation and vanish each one you see. Stay focused and be careful cause things  are about to keep tougher now. Humans are cowards and they are putting weak men in front while the stronger one are locked inside their dungeons. On the other hand, spaces you shall ground are getting fewer and fewer. You can eat them ALL. I\'m sure no one can stop you... Let this be a MASSACRE everyone will remember for AGES

## Stage 2

In this stage, you will see that the landing platforms have become smaller so the landing is kinda more diffucult. Again, the goal remains the same. You only have to climb higher and increasing your scoring by killing humans. Your goal now is set to 551 so you can procced to the next level.

## 2nd Pop-Up Message

They say that whoever has the WILL, it also has the WAY and it seems you have both.I\m it wasn't that hard for you to reach up here right? One last stop and you will be the RULER of the world.Only a few have left for you to eat.Things are much tougher now  but I don't feel like this will a problem for you. You are the ONE! Get higher and extinct the human race forever. Planet Earth will be a much better place for all of you. Can you do that? 

## Stage 3

This is the last stage in our little game. In this stage, platforms have become again even smaller so it's hardest to navigate between them. Are you able to reach scoring of 1201? If you manage to get there you will be the winner and you will see the last scene where you can save your score.
